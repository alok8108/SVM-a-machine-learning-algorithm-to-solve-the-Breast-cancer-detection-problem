# SVM-a-machine-learning-algorithm-to-solve-the-Breast-cancer-detection-problem
In this project I have tried to solve the problem of breast cancer detection using support vector machines.
The project uses the features of breast cancer dataset such as mean radius', 'mean texture', 'mean perimeter', 'mean area','mean smoothness', 'mean compactness.....
to classify the cancer into malignant and benign.
The algorithms that we used here are Logistic regressuon and SVM. The logistic regression method is found to give better results than the untuned SVM model by giving the train and test acc as 0.9472527472527472, 0.9298245614035088 %.\
The tuned model of SVM showed better results than the Logistic regression i.e. 95.2% acc. We used grid search CV and Randomized search cv to find the best set of hyperparameters giving the better results.
